    Some examples: 

    If A extends B, because B doesn't inherit anything, all of the attributes from B are immediately added to A. Now A and B are resolved.

    If A extends B and B extends C, first B needs to be resolved. 
    So 'A' will be added to 'unresolved' and resolveInheritance(B, {A}, {})  will be called.
    Afterwards 'B' will be added to resolved and it's attributes will be added to A.

    If A extends B and B extends C and C extends A, there is a circled dependency.
    After one recursion steps, resolveInheritance(C, {A, B}, {}) will be called. Then because 'C' extends a class from the unresolved set a runtime exception will be thrown.
